- The [datasheet][datasheet] says that we can program via self sector programming (SSP) or JTAG. We don't want
  to rely on SSP because that requires that we can still speak to the firmware.
  - There might be a way to activate the bootloader by applying the right values at power on. We don't know
    because we only know the main application from the firmware update files.
  - JTAG would be great because that should work in all cases.
  - If we have JTAG, we can extract the complete firmware (unless the memory is read-protected).
- The datasheet says: "The SH68F83 will enter ICP mode once specified waveform of TCK, TDI, TMS and TDO pins
  is detected within a limited period after system POR. To get more details, please refer Flash Programmerâ€™s user manual."
  - I couldn't find that document.
  - You can download ProWriter on the vendor's [website][sinoweb]. It does include a PDF that describes the flashing process
    but only for "connect this probe, click here in the GUI".
- ProWriter does include the firmware for several of the USB-to-JTAG adapters.
  - Most of them are in an unknown format but JET51A seems to be a raw binary file for STM32F4 or similar.
  - It is for an ARM process, little endian, only thumb instructions, loaded at 0x08010000.
  - I assume that the flash starts at 0x08000000 but there is a bootloader in the first 64 kB. The firmware is also
    64 kB so that would be a 128 kB device, which is quite small for an STM32F4. The RAM starts at 0x2000000 and the stack
    base suggests that there are 64 kB of RAM.
- The firmware contains some functions that do JTAG bitbanging.
  - PB6=TCK, PB7=TDI, PB8=TDO, PB9=TMS
  - B12 could be an active-high reset signal but it probably controls VDD.
  - There are some functions that drive non-JTAG waveforms to those pins. I think those are the "specified waveforms".
  - The software is also using channel 0 of ADC1, which is on PA0.
  - GPIO direction:
    (gdb) x/1x 0x40020014  # GPIOA: no outputs
    0x40020014:     0x00000000
    (gdb) x/1x 0x40020414  # GPIOB: PB7, PB10, PB11 are outputs
    0x40020414:     0x00000c80
    (gdb) x/1x 0x40020814  # GPIOC: PC0, PC3, PC6, PC7 are outputs
    0x40020814:     0x000000c9
  - This doesn't match my earlier assumptions about the JTAG pins.
  - 0x0801d9ea is not treating FLASH_CR.7 as reserved so this is probably for STM32F4nx with n=2 or 3 instead of 0 or 1
    (for which that bit would be reserved).
- Goal: Make that firmware work on some STM32F4, e.g. my STM32F411 Nucleo board.
  - Add some simple bootloader replacement that jumps to the application code.
  - USB is already working fine.
  - It hangs around `read_adc_dezivolt_08010b08`.
  - 0x08010340 in main jumps back to earlier code.
